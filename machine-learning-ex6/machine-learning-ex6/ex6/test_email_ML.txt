Hello dear researcher

Please give us a few minutes of your precious time to read this text.
I hope you will always be successful and proud.
In this short time, I would like to introduce you with some people that your mind has been looking for many years.

Fourteen centuries ago, there was a family who were the wisest people on earth.
That dear and lovely family was the best in science, politeness, knowledge, good behavior and all good deeds.
They taught this unique and complete science to other people, but due to the low level of understanding or Misunderstand of the majority of the people of that time, the people rejected that family and even killed the members of that family.
(Such as the rejection of Galileo after the famous discovery or other inappropriate behavior with scientists written in history)

this family, named "Ahl al-Bayt".
For example, one of the Ahl al-Bayt is Mr. "Hussain". He was martyred in 680 AD. His tomb is in the city of Karbala, Iraq.
The Iraqi people love Hussain and his brother "Abbas" so much that they donate their property for free for 10 days every year on special days.
During those 10 days [called "Arbaeen Walk"], all food and drink and rest are completely free and More than thirty million people participate And More than one billion meals are donated on Arbaeen Days. Some People's know Arbaeen Walk as a 90 km free hotel and dining table.




Mr. Mahdi

Only one of the Ahl al-Bayt is alive. his name is Mahdi. He is The Promised Saviour.
Mahdi is exactly like Hussain, but for fear of being killed, God has commanded him to hide, and God will never order Mahdi to come until people promise God that they will guarantee Mahdi.

The words of the elders about Hussein


Prophet Mohammad: Hussain is from me and I am from Hussain.
Mahatma Gandhi : I learnt from Hussain how to achieve victory while being oppressed.
Charles Dickens: If Hussain had fought to quench his worldly desires, then I do not understand why his sister, wife and children accompanied him.
Edward Gibbon: His sacrifice is for all groups and communities, an example of the path of righteousness. In a distant age and climate the tragic scene of the death of Hussain will awaken the sympathy of the coldest reader.
Edward Granville Browne: Is there a heart that may not brim with grief and sorrow when it hears about the tragedy of Karbala, even a non-Muslim also cannot deny the cleanliness and purity of this Islamic war

and more ..... Antoine Bara .... Edoardo Agnelli....

Now, dear scientists, Let's think a little about the following questions:


Why every year during the Arbaeen days of Imam Hussein PBUH more than one billion free meals with accommodation with all free facilities are provided to pilgrims?

What is the Arbaeen Walk?

Who is Imam Hussain?

Who is Imam Mahdi (PBUH)?

Who is The Promised Saviour?
