Dear All,

 

Beacon Partners, EARB, CS-representatives, Third parties and Project Officer, I hope you and your dear ones are all well!

 

First a kind reminder that our next Annual meeting in Beacon is scheduled 14-15 April. It will not be possible to have a physical meeting so it will be online. Agenda and links will come closer to the event.
 

WP6 has delivered deliverable D6.2 with the title CS perspectives with a focus on verification and validation of models, and comparing models with situations close to disposal conditions (task 5.1 and 5.2). It is hereby distributed to all Beacon Partners before submission in accordance with Beacon CA. It is also hereby distributed to the EARB for review. If there are objections to it or comments that may lead to adjustments of the deliverable, please provide those to Johan Swahn johan.swahn@mkg.se, with a copy to me before 10 Feb.  D6.2 is available in Projectplace here https://service.projectplace.com/pp/pp.cgi/r1218262656 . Thank you Johan and Nadja!
 

CEAÂ´s has a new contact person, we welcome Christophe Imbert, christophe.imbert@cea.fr. Fabien Bernachy-Barbe will continue to work at CEA but in a different lab. Thank you Fabien for your engagement in Beacon! I will keep him in the loop and we might see him at a final conference.
 

The Beacon contact list at Projectplace has been updated (several times). Available on Projectplace here https://service.projectplace.com/pp/pp.cgi/r1390025894 and also attached. Please use the updated one.
